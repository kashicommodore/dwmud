Aliases and Nicknames

What are Aliases?
Basically, aliases are a way to make your own commands. Usually what this means is to make long and hard to type commands shorter. 
But you can also chain up many commands together, or simplify short, repeatative tasks.

How do you make an Alias?
<> alias <name> <command> <>
for example
<> alias helloworld shout hello world I made an alias <>
will make a helloworld command, which makes your character shout

Lets get to the basics of what you need to get by.
Of course, feel free to adjust these to suit yourself.

First, lets simply make the kill command shorter.
<>alias k kill $*$<>

This will mean you can type 'k rat' instead of 'kill rat' in future. Quicker, no?
The $*$ bit means 'anything I typed after the alias goes here'. So 'k sailor' becomes 'kill sailor'. Geddit?

To make aliases easier to list and browse ingame later, we can put them in categories too.
<>alias set category k General<>
Will put this alias in a new 'General' category.

Lets try something else.
The consider command allows you to weigh up an opponenet before you bash heads and swords. This can save you getting killed by enemies much tougher than you.
<>alias c consider $arg:all$<>
<>alias set category c General<>
So 'c rat' will 'consider rat'. Easy.
The $arg:all$ bit means either 'use the word I put after the alias' ('c rat' becomes 'consider rat'), 
OR if I did not use any word - use 'all' instead. ('c' becomes 'consider all')

I like to make varients of this command to quickly consider my target (who I am alrady fighting), or the wounded too. Try these.
<>alias ca consider all<>
<>alias set category ca General<>
<>alias ct consider target<>
<>alias set category ct General<>
<>alias cw consider wounded<>
<>alias set category cw General<>

Another useful one is the 'health' command, which guages an opponents, or a friends, current health. See who is injured!

<>alias h health $arg:me$<>
<>alias set category h General<>
<>alias ha health all<>
<>alias set category ha General<>
<>alias ht health target<>
<>alias set category ht General<>
<>alias hw health wounded<>
<>alias set category hw General<>
