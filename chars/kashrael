describe zone head clear
describe zone hair His hair is like midnight - black but with a subtle shine of blue as the light hits it. Its shoulder-length, greasy and tangled.
describe zone eyes $NEW_LINE$His eyes are a deep emerald green, and his stare is somewhat disconcerting.
describe zone face $NEW_LINE$He is the type to seemingly be locked in a scowl, even when he's not angry. And pale. Too pale. Corpse-like. He even has a blue tinge to his lips.
describe zone neck His neck has a strange scar across it. Or is it a bruise?
describe zone arms His bare arms are athletic, muscular but not rippling. A selection of faded tattoos adorn them.
describe zone legs His bare legs look strong and firm. They sport a few scars. The hairline seems to suggest he rides a horse regularly.
describe zone hands His hands have a patchwork of scars and cuts across them, a hazard of his profession no doubt.
describe zone feet He has rather large feet.
describe zone back clear
